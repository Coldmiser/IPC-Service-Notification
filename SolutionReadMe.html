    IPC-[something] Client/Server Example in C#

    <h2>Using a [something maybe <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/signalr">SignalR</a>] for IPC</h2>

        <h3>
            Service
        </h3>
        <p>
            The service is written as a Console application using the TopShelf plug-in so troubleshooting is easier.  It can be run as a Console application, but is designed as a service.  Information on the TopShelf plug-in can be found <a href="http://topshelf-project.com/">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The service can be installed by running the application with the following command line parameters:
            <ul>
                <li>service.exe install start</li>
                <li>service.exe uninstall</li>
                <li>service.exe <i>-instance</i> (if registering the service multiple times)</li>
                <li>service.exe <i>-username -password</i></li>
                <li>service.exe help</li>
            </ul>
            Along with a multitude of examples which can be found <a href="https://topshelf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/commandline.html">here</a>

            Deployment
        </h3>
        <p>
            The deployment method used for this solution is the Visual Studio Package Manager.   I had previously used Squirrel Package Manager with it, but it did not give me the options that I was looking for so I am currently switching off of Squirrel and onto the VS Package Manager.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The package is deployed by using Squirrel Package manager, this is done from with-in the Visual Studio Package Manager Console.  Simply select the Package Manager Console (View &#8594; Other Windows &#8594; Package Manager Console) and type:  <b>Squirrel --releasify Service.1.0.0.nupkg</b>.  This will use your nupkg file to create the EXE and MSI files.  A new nupkg file should be created for each release and added to source control.
